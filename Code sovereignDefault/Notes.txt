The sovereign default model: 

The model follows Aguiar and Gopinath (2006) JIE model (includes exogenous cyclical and trend growth shocks), 
but augmented with long-maturity debts (Chatterjee and Eyigungor, 2012, AER) and debt renegotiation (Mihalache, 2020, JIE). 

The model has tow exogenous states (m,z) (trend, cycle) and one endogenous state b (debts). m and z are 
discretized into 25 and 25 grids, b discretized into 200/400 grids.
